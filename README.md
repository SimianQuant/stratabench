Strata Bench
===

[Strata](https://github.com/OpenGamma/Strata) is an award winning open source analytics and market risk library published 
by OpenGamma. The company is [opaque](http://strata.opengamma.io/performance/) about the performance of the library and 
its subcomponents, with vague references to closed source prototypes and benchmarks run a decade ago. This project aims
to provide rigourous benchmarks for the library and its subcomponents using 
[Java Microbenchmark Harness](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/). For convenience, the benchmarks are 
written in Scala using [sbt-jmh](https://github.com/ktoso/sbt-jmh).
